i am using the lazyvim distribution of neovim. it comes with a file picker. the file picker has preview on by default. however, i find the previews often load slowly, which freezes the entire editor. also, it has preview images, and preview images do not work correctly in my terminal: they load, and then stay on the screen even after i switch to another file.

i think the simplest option is to disable the file previews somehow, which would fix both issues.

here is one of the commands for opening the file picker:

```lua
      { "<leader>fF", LazyVim.pick("files", { root = false }), desc = "Find Files (cwd)" },

```

is there a way to disable the preview feature in this command?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, you can disable the preview feature in the file picker used by LazyVim. LazyVim uses `telescope.nvim` as its default file picker, and Telescope allows you to customize its behavior, including disabling previews.

In your LazyVim configuration, you can override the default settings for Telescope to disable previews. LazyVim provides a way to customize plugin configurations via the `opts` field in the plugin spec. Since you're using LazyVim, you can modify the Telescope configuration to disable previews globally or for specific pickers.

Here’s how you can disable previews for the `files` picker (or globally for all Telescope pickers):

### Step 1: Locate or Create Your Telescope Configuration
LazyVim allows you to customize plugins in your `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` directory. If you don't already have a file for Telescope configuration, you can create one or modify an existing file (e.g., `telescope.lua`).

### Step 2: Disable Previews in Telescope
Add or update the following code in your configuration (e.g., `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/telescope.lua`):

```lua
return {
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  opts = {
    defaults = {
      preview = false, -- Disable previews globally for all Telescope pickers
    },
    pickers = {
      find_files = {
        preview = false, -- Disable previews specifically for the 'files' picker
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Step 3: Apply the Configuration
Save the file and reload your Neovim configuration. You can do this by restarting Neovim or running `:Lazy sync` if you’ve made changes to the plugin spec.

### Alternative: Modify the Specific Command
If you don’t want to disable previews globally or for all `find_files` pickers, you can customize the specific command `<leader>fF` to disable previews. LazyVim's `pick` utility (used in your keymap) allows passing options to Telescope.

Update the keymap in your configuration (likely in `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua` or a similar file) to pass a `preview = false` option:

```lua
{ "<leader>fF", LazyVim.pick("files", { root = false, preview = false }), desc = "Find Files (cwd)" },
```

However, note that `LazyVim.pick` may not directly support passing `preview = false` as an argument (it depends on how `LazyVim.pick` is implemented). If this doesn’t work, you can directly call Telescope with the appropriate options:

```lua
{ "<leader>fF", function() require("telescope.builtin").find_files({ root = false, preview = false }) end, desc = "Find Files (cwd)" },
```

### Explanation of Options
- **`preview = false`**: This disables the preview window in Telescope. Without a preview, the picker will load faster and won’t attempt to display file contents or images, resolving both the slowness and the lingering image issue in your terminal.
- **`defaults`**: Settings under `defaults` apply to all Telescope pickers unless overridden in the `pickers` section.
- **`pickers.find_files`**: Specific settings for the `find_files` picker (used by `LazyVim.pick("files")`).

### Additional Notes
1. **Terminal Image Preview Issue**: The lingering image issue is likely due to how your terminal handles image rendering (e.g., via `kitty` or `wezterm` image protocols). Disabling previews will avoid this problem entirely. If you want to keep previews for text files but disable image previews, you can configure Telescope’s `previewers` to skip certain file types, but that’s more complex and likely unnecessary if you’re fine with disabling previews.
2. **Performance**: Disabling previews should significantly improve the responsiveness of the file picker, especially for large directories or slow file systems.
3. **LazyVim Documentation**: If you’re unsure where to place the configuration, check LazyVim’s documentation or the structure of your `~/.config/nvim/lua/` directory. LazyVim often provides examples or pre-existing files for plugin customization.

After applying one of the above solutions, the file picker should open without previews, and both the slowness and image persistence issues should be resolved. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
